# Demonstrations & Examples

Code to illustrate the usage of various components of the mpc_orb package

### (1) How to read/parse a given mpc_orb.json file

 - It is expected that these parsing functions will be used regularly by both internal MPC staff & external community users.

 - The code to do the parsing is provided in mpc_orb/parse.py

 - Both "demo_parse.py" and "Example_parse_mpcorb_json.ipynb" provide the same basic example of how to parse a given mpc_orb.json file using the code in the mpc_orb/parse.py module.


### (2) How to use the "describe" function to get information on any given "attribute" of the MPCORB object

 - Provides some more information to the user, describing both the topline "meaning" of the atttribute, as well as units (where relevant)
