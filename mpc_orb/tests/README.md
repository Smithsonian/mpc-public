# json_files

Directory to store various json files.

I intend that there be *no* json files at the top-level

The contained directories have the following intended usages

### (i) schema_json

Schema file(s) against which examples of the mpc's mpc_orb-json format can be validated 

### (i) test_jsons
 
 Various example json files to test the code.
 Some are deliberately valid, some deliberately invalid.
