# Edgar Wilson Award Information

The Edgar Wilson Award is conferred annually to amateur astronomers who have discovered one or more comets. Under the Will of Edgar Wilson of Lexington, KY, a Trust was established from which a fraction of the annual proceeds would be provided to the [Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO)](https://www.si.edu/about/astrophysical-observatory) to administer a perpetual program in support of amateur astronomy.

The terms of the bequest from 1996 - 2020 instructed that the funds be used to identify and honor amateur astronomers who discovered comets during the preceding year. In October of 2020, the terms of the bequest were changed such that the SAO should use the funds to:

- Organize programs for amateur astronomers, where the programs shall consist of presentations and training sessions from leading astronomers in the field of comets and asteroids.
- Honor amateur astronomers who discovered comets during the preceding year with a commemorative plaque.

Information regarding the Edgar Wilson Award recipients by year can be found on the [Award Winners](edgar-wilson-award-winners.md) page.
