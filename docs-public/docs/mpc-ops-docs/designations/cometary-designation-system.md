# Cometary Designation System

The resolution below was published on *Minor Planet Circulars* 23803-4, and subsequently
appeared in the
[*International Comet Quarterly*](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/icq/icq.html), **16**, 127.

Note that since this resolution was adopted:

- all responsibility for handling comets is the function of the Minor Planet Center
  (MPC), as the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT) is no longer an IAU
  center;
- the SBNC became the CSBN, which then became the WGSBN; and
- Commission 20 was replaced by Commission X2.

The following resolution concerning designations and names of comets was adopted by the
International Astronomical Union at its [1994] General Assembly in The Hague on Aug. 24:

1. Commission 20 of the IAU, considering that:
    - there is essentially a 1:1 correspondence between the provisional (year/letter) and
      definitive (year/Roman numeral) designation systems for comets;
    - the procedure for interpolating old discoveries of comets into the existing
      designation systems is unsatisfactory, particularly when orbit determinations are
      not available;
    - the application of a new designation at each return of a periodic comet to
      perihelion is an unnecessary complication, particularly when the comet's recovery
      can be described as "routine", or for the rapidly increasing number of periodic
      comets that are followed all around their orbits; and
    - there can be confusion whether a newly-discovered object is a comet or a minor
      planet,

    proposes to replace the present designation systems for comets with a system that
    closely resembles, but is not identical to, the designation system for minor planets.

2. Specifically, it is resolved that the year/letter and year/Roman numeral systems be
   replaced by one in which each cometary discovery is given a designation consisting of
   the year of observation, the upper-case code letter identifying the halfmonth of
   observation during that year
   [according to the procedure used for minor planets](provisional-designations.md),
   and a consecutive numeral to indicate the order of discovery announcement during that
   halfmonth. Each new designation shall be supplied by the IAU Central Bureau for
   Astronomical Telegrams when the discovery is announced in one of its *Circulars*. For
   example, the third comet reported as discovered during the second half of February
   1995 would be designated 1995 D3.

3. The nature of an object can further be indicated by an initial prefix. In particular,
   such prefixes should be applied in cases where comets have possibly been misdesignated
   as minor planets, or vice versa. If necessary, the prefix A/ would precede a comet
   designation that actually refers to a minor planet (or asteroid). For comets the
   acceptable prefixes are P/ for a periodic comet (defined to have a revolution period
   of less than 200 years or confirmed observations at more than one perihelion passage)
   and C/ for a comet that is *not* periodic (in this sense), with the addition of X/
   for a comet for which a meaningful orbit can not be computed and D/ for a periodic
   comet that no longer exists or is deemed to have disappeared.

4. If a comet is observed to return (or have its periodicity established by observation
   through aphelion or from identifications), the P/ (or D/) shall be preceded by an
   official sequential number (e.g., 1P/1682 Q1 = Halley), the list to be maintained by
   the Minor Planet Center and published in the *Minor Planet Circulars*. Subsequent
   recoveries shall be acknowledged with further designations only when the predictions
   are particularly uncertain.

5. The practice of providing future predictions for the returns to perihelion of all
   periodic comets for which there is a reasonable chance of future observations will
   continue. While this currently means, for example, the publication of predictions for
   the comets for the year *n* in the batch of *Minor Planet Circulars* for May of the
   year *n-3*, the elements being for the 40-day date closest to perihelion passage, it
   is to be expected that this process will be supplemented -- and perhaps eventually
   supplanted -- by one that provides the orbital elements for these comets routinely at
   epochs 200 days apart, as in the case of minor planets.

6. In the case of a comet that has separated into discrete components, those components
   should be distinguished by appending -A, -B, etc., to the designation (or to the P/
   or D/ periodic comet number).

7. Noting that some redundancy of nomenclature is desirable, it is proposed to retain in
   general terms the tradition of naming comets for their discoverers. In this framework,
   a committee has been formed to establish more precise procedures to ensure fairness and
   simplicity.

8. It is proposed that comet names be announced in the *IAU Circulars* only following
   consultation between the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams and the Commission
   20 Small Bodies Names Committee.

9. Whereas the new designation system for comets implies the possibility of confusion (if
   incorrect spacing is used) with that for new planetary satellites, it is proposed to
   indicate satellites with the prefix S/.

10. It is proposed that the new designation system for comets be introduced at the
    beginning of the year 1995. In the interests of avoiding confusion and maintaining
    continuity, Roman numeral designations will be published in the *Minor Planet
    Circulars* for pre-1995 comet discoveries/recoveries passing perihelion in 1993 and
    1994, and new-style designations will be supplied for pre-1995 comets, together with
    lists of correlations with both the year/letter and the year/Roman numeral.
