   "source": "# MPC Identifications API\n\n#### This tutorial demonstrates how to submit suggested identifications (linkages) to the Minor Planet Center using the Identifications API.\n\nThe MPC uses the term \"identification\" to refer to the discovery that two or more sets of observations belong to the same underlying object. There are four types of linkage:\n\n- **ITF-to-ITF**: Linking isolated tracklets together to create a new designation.\n- **ITF-to-DES**: Linking a tracklet to an existing designated object.\n- **DES-to-DES**: Linking two or more designated objects together.\n- **NEOCP-to-NEOCP**: Linking NEOCP candidates together.\n\nIn the examples below we use [python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) code to demonstrate submission of identifications via the API.\n\nFurther information and documentation concerning the submission of identifications to the MPC can be found at:\n - [Identifications API documentation](https://docs.minorplanetcenter.net/mpc-ops-docs/apis/identifications/)\n - [Identifications overview](https://docs.minorplanetcenter.net/mpc-ops-docs/identifications/)\n - [MPC criteria for accepting or rejecting identifications](https://docs.minorplanetcenter.net/mpc-ops-docs/identifications/acceptance-criteria/)\n - [Submit identifications (upload form)](https://minorplanetcenter.net/mpcops/submissions/identifications/)"

    "### Link Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "| Field | Required | Description |\n",
    "| ----- | -------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| `designations` | No* | List of packed designations (e.g. `K10TD3E` for unnumbered, `s2334` for numbered). |\n",
    "| `trksubs` | No* | List of tracklets, each specified as `[trkSub, date, obs-code]`. |\n",
    "| `orbit` | No | Optional orbital elements for the linkage. |\n",

    "- Designations must be in **packed form** (e.g. `K10TD3E` not `2010 TD3E`).\n",
    "- The backslash `\\` is a reserved character in JSON. If a `trkSub` begins with a backslash, it must be escaped as `\\\\`.\n",
