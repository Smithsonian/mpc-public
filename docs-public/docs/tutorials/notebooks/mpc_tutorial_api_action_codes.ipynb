    "#### This tutorial provides information on how to use the Minor Planet Center's Action Codes API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Minor Planet Center's `Action Codes` service allows you to retrieve action codes that were sent when you originally submitted observations to the MPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are Action Codes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Action codes are automatically generated codes that are sent to the submitters of new NEO and new comet candidates as well as to the NEO/NEOPC follow-up reporters. These action codes can be used to:\n",
    " - Retract (delete) your submitted observations\n",
    " - Replace observations with corrected versions\n",
    " - Prove ownership of your submissions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've lost your action code, this API can help you retrieve it. **The action code will be emailed to the original submitter's address.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Action Codes API is a REST endpoint. You can send POST requests to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    https://data.minorplanetcenter.net/api/action-codes/retrieve\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below we use Python code to query the API.\n",
