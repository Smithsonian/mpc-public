    "This tutorial assumes you have successfully created and validated an ADES-formated file of observations. \n",

    "In the examples below we use [python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) code to demonstrate the submission of observations, but one can use other tools such as [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) to submit observations. \n",

    "**Tip:** The [`mpc_api`](https://github.com/Smithsonian/mpc-public/tree/main/mpc_api) Python package (`pip install mpc-api`) wraps all MPC API calls into a single `MPCClient` class and provides an alternative means to access the Submission API. Examples using `mpc_api` are shown [below](#using-the-mpc_api-package)."
