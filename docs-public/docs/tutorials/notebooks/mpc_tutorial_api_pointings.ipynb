    "The MPC Pointings Database collects details about telescope exposures — direction, timing, duration, and field geometry — relevant to the near-Earth object (NEO) community. The database facilitates:\n",

    "- Community coordination of NEO follow-up activities\n",
    "- Internal MPC data processing\n",
    "- Community pre-recovery efforts\n",

    "- **Exposed pointings** — recorded at or near the actual time of exposure\n",
    "- **Queued pointings** — scheduled observations (future capability)\n",
