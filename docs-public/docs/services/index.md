Once developed, this page will provide links to various MPC services.

Many of these services are hosted on other sections of the MPC's website, 
with this page serving simply as a landing page to access them.

## Check Near-Duplicate Observations (CND)
Query the MPC's database of observations to find potential near-duplicates of your own observations. 
This can be used to check for potential matches to known objects, 
or to check for potential duplicates of your own observations 
(e.g. if someone already submitted the same observations).
